# The old one, the default service named tomcat.service.
# The new named instances are called tomcat@instance.service.
#
# Use this file to change default values for all services.
# Change the service specific ones to affect only one service.
# For tomcat.service it's /etc/sysconfig/tomcat, for
# tomcat@instance it's /etc/sysconfig/tomcat@instance.

#
# Use "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" to enable the CMS garbage collector (improved
# response time). If you use that option and you run Tomcat on a machine with
# exactly one CPU chip that contains one or two cores, you should also add
# the "-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode" option.
